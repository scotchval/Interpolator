Interpolator
============

Implementations of a variety of interpolation technique. This project follows a course that I am 
currently taking in Numerical Analysis

Much of the math used in this project directly came from a course in Numerical Analysis at Duke
University taught by Mark Iwen.
The textbook used was Numerical Analysis: Mathematics of Scientific Computer third edition by
David Kincaid and Ward Cheney


Current Ideas for stuff to add
----------------------------------
1. tension splines
2. variable degree splines (odd) - maybe not (this is difficult w/o more info)
3. b splines (maybe change the splines we currently have)
4. splines that can circle around in 2D (spline a circle instead of a function)
